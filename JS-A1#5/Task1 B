b. Explain break. What is its purpose and when should it be used. Use an example to explain

The break statement is frequently used to terminate the processing of a particular
case within a switch statement.

the break statement terminates only the do, for, switch, or while statement that 
immediately encloses it. 
You can use a return or goto statement to transfer control elsewhere out 
of the nested structure.

Example
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    // break condition     
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
