//What are primitive data types. Name all of them with examples/

//primitive data types are data types that refer to a single value.
//E.g. var a =10;
/*Here the variable ‘a’ is an integer data type and has a single integer value. 
The variable ‘a’ refers to a single value in memory*/

//Primitive data types are number, string, boolean, NULL, and undefined.

/*Number - A number data type can be an integer, 
//a floating point value, an exponential value, a ‘NaN’ or a ‘Infinity’ */
var a=250;  // integer value

/* string - The string data type in JavaScript can be any group
 of characters enclosed by a single or double-quotes or by backticks.*/
 var str1 = “This is a string1”; 

//boolean - The boolean data type has only two values, true and false. 
typeof(true) // returns boolean
typeof(false) // returns boolean

/*Null -The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, 
the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value.*/
var a = null;
console.log(a);   // This returns null

undefined - /*Undefined data type means a variable that is not defined. 
The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.*/
var a;
console.log(a); // This will return undefined.
