What are the 3 parts of a for loop

for(initializer; condition; iteration)
{
    // Code to be executed
}

The for loop requires following three parts.

Initializer: Initialize a counter variable to start with
Condition: specify a condition that must evaluate to true for next iteration
Iteration: increase or decrease counter

Example for loop
for (let i =0; i<3; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
